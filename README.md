# Predicting Job Change Intentions Among Data Scientist Candidates

## Summary
Understanding why employees consider leaving their roles is crucial, especially in specialized fields like Data Science. 
This study employs a multilevel modeling approach to identify factors influencing job change intentions among data scientist candidates. 
Our findings could help HR to develop strategies while optimizing training resources and hiring decisions.


## Setup
This project is developed using R and R Studio. Refer to `mice_project-report.RMD` for the required packages.


## Data
Our dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of 19,158 observations across 12 key columns, capturing attributes from individual 
experience to city metrics. The primary outcome is the 'target' column, a binary indicator of job change intention.
